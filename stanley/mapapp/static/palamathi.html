    The temple is located in Sripuram, a spiritual park in Thirumalaikodi, about 9 km away from the hills. The temple is famous for its golden exterior that covers an area of about 1500 kg of gold. The temple also has a star-shaped path that leads to the main shrine, which symbolises the path to enlightenment.
